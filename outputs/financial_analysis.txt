**1. Executive Summary:**
In Q2 2025, Tesla's transition into a leader in AI and robotics along with their continued efforts in electric vehicles and renewable energies were highlighted. The launch of the first Robotaxi service in Austin marks a significant pivot in autonomy services. Revenue decreased by 12% YoY to $22.5B, with significant impacts observed due to declining vehicle deliveries, reduced ASPs, and lower regulatory credit revenue. Despite challenges, Tesla's innovative R&D in AI, combined with a resilient supply chain, positions them for growth in semiconductors and robotics.

**2. Key Financial Metrics:**
